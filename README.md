# Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer  

### ✨ Overview  
The **Dijkstra Algorithm Visualizer** is an interactive Python-based tool that graphically demonstrates Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in action. It allows users to input start and end nodes dynamically, visualize weighted graph traversal, and understand the shortest path computation in real-time with a clean and aesthetically pleasing interface.

### 🛠️ Key Features  
- **Interactive Inputs:**  
  Users can specify the start and end nodes interactively using input boxes.  
- **Real-Time Visualization:**  
  Watch the algorithm step through, dynamically updating the graph and highlighting the shortest path.  
- **Custom Design:**  
  - Enhanced visuals with vibrant colors and a clear layout for nodes and edges.  
  - Semi-transparent labels for edge weights.  
  - Intuitive panel for displaying the shortest path and distance details.  
- **Node and Edge Setup:**  
  - Predefined graph with labeled nodes (`A-F`) and weighted edges for experimentation.  
  - Automatic updates for paths and distances when input changes.
